            "You’re a prince, you’re a snare, you’re a shadow

            You’re twilight and star burn and shade
            
            You’re a sage, you’re a wound shared, you’re masked
            
            You’re a pillar of smoke, you’re a platinum heart
            
            You’re a brush fire, you’re caged, you’re free
            
            Your vision pierces, you do not see
            
            You are pieces strewn on the hillside
            
            You’re open armed, you’re armed, you’re true
            
            You’re a revealer of visions, you’re the passenger, you’re a never fading scar
            
            You’re twilight and star burn and shade
            
            You’re the secret veiled, you’re the secret revealed, you’re surrounded no more
            
            You’re not there, now you’re always here
            
            You’re a handsome groom, a loving father, a haunted stairwell
            
            You’re the clear bell ringing, the mountains echo your song
            
            Maybe no one has ever known you
            
            You are twilight and star burn and shade"
